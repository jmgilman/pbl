# PicoBlade

PicoBlade (Pbl for short) is a modern open-source CI/CD platform for application delivery in Kubernetes.
It's built using a combination of custom tooling written in Go, [Pkl] for configuration, and [Dagger] for CI.
It features a single-file configuration for specifying how an application should be built and deployed.
Deployments are handled by [Argo CD] using GitOps best practices.

## Under Development

Pbl is in the inception phase and is under active development.
